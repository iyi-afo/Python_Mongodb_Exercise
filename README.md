This project explores a media content dataset stored in MongoDB, focusing on movies and TV shows from various countries and genres. The analysis is performed using Jupyter Notebook and includes aggregation pipelines to extract valuable insights such as:

Distribution of content types (Movies vs TV Shows)

Country-specific content breakdown (e.g., content from India)

Duration analysis for filtering long-form content

The dataset includes fields such as:

title

type (Movie / TV Show)

rating (e.g., PG, TV-MA)

duration (e.g., "90 min", "2 Seasons")

country, cast, description, etc.
